# Grocery Store

Grocery Store is a single page web app that displays store products and allows you to add them to a cart and simulate a check-out.  Items can be added or removed from the cart and quantities increased or decreased.  A user can check out by providing an address and reviewing the totals and subtotals of the cart items.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Setting up JSON server

In the same project directory but new terminal, you can run the json-server (if it's installed globally):

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

The json-server will generate the following routes:
